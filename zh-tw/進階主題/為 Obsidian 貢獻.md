Thanks for the interest in contributing to Obsidian!

There are three major ways you can contribute:

### 1. Financial contribution

#### Commercial license

If you'd like to use Obsidian for work activities，try to let your work get you a [[Commercial license|commercial license]].

#### 附加功能服務

If you'd like to make a website from your notes，consider getting [[Obsidian Publish]] if the price works for you.

If you're interested in an end-to-end encryption syncing solution，we also offer [[Obsidian Sync]]. In addition to end-to-end encryption，Obsidian Sync also comes with version history.

#### Catalyst

If you don't need any of the above，you can get a [[Catalyst license]] to support our developer，which also gives you access to [[Insider builds]].

#### Obsidian Unlimited

For those very passionate about the project，there's also the Obsidian Unlimited option，which lets you pay as much as you want to support development and help us stay independent. We recommend going for this option after you've purchased the VIP tier of [[Catalyst license]] so that you can enjoy the benefits.

### 2. Extending Obsidian

#### CSS 主題

如果您精通 CSS，another way is to contribute a theme，so that people who don't know CSS can enjoy your work. If you decide to do so，歡迎在我們的 Discord 伺服器中的 #css-themes 頻道，或是論壇的 Share & Showcase 分類中分享。

If you'd like to add your theme to the community theme list，let us know! (Or we might reach out to you first!)

#### 擴充功能

如果您會使用 JavaScript 或是 TypeScript，您可以為 Obsidian 開發 [[第三方擴充功能]]，我們的擴充功能 API 已經進入 alpha 階段了。

### 3. 翻譯和校對

#### 翻譯界面

如果您熟悉其他語言 (母語人士優先)，you can help with translating the Obsidian interface into your language. You can do that by submitting a pull request in [our translation GitHub repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations) to get it into the next version of the app.

#### 翻譯文檔

我們正在整理並統一您現在正在閱讀的文檔。一旦完成，您也可以幫助我們翻譯，讓那些不熟英文的人也能很容易地學習使用 Obsidian。
